# Pyramid Scheme

Imagine that someone, claiming to represent an investment company, offers you a quick way to multiply your money. The only thing you need to do is persuade three of your friends to invest as well. In reality, however, your money will not be used to purchase gold or stocks. Instead, it will be divided among the people who joined the company before you.  

If you succeed in convincing three friends, you will receive a share of their money — and also of the money from the people they recruit — until the entire system collapses due to a lack of new investors and the company’s owner mysteriously flies off to the Bahamas. It should be added that situations like this rarely benefit friendships.

You have just fallen victim to one of the most widespread fraudulent business models — a *pyramid scheme*.

### Assignment

The founder of the company (the first level of the pyramid) recruits three investors (the second level of the pyramid) and collects a fixed entry fee of $20\,000\,\text{CZK}$ from each of them. Each of these three investors must then recruit three new investors (the third level of the pyramid) and again collect an entry fee of $20\,000\,\text{CZK}$ from each. The same process continues at each subsequent level.  

For simplicity, assume that recruitment for a new level begins only after the previous level has been completely filled. For example, recruitment into the fourth level begins only after all nine investors in the third level have joined.

The entry fee paid by each new member is distributed among existing participants as follows: $6\,000\,\text{CZK}$ goes to person A, who recruited the new member; $1\,000\,\text{CZK}$ goes to person B, who recruited person A; another $1\,000\,\text{CZK}$ goes to person C, who recruited person B; another $1\,000\,\text{CZK}$ goes to person D, who recruited person C; and so on, until the entire entry fee has been distributed. If part of the fee reaches the founder of the company, the founder receives the remaining amount.

> **Problem 1.**  
> When does a newly joined participant recover the money paid as the entry fee?

> **Problem 2.**  
> At a certain level of the pyramid, it happens for the first time that the founder of the company receives no money from the entry fees of the new members.
>
> 1. At which level of the pyramid are these new members?  
> 2. How many people are in the entire pyramid after this level has been filled? Compare this number with the number of people in your school or in your town.  
> 3. Determine the percentage of people who are at a loss after this level has been filled.

Pyramid schemes, also known as “airplane games,” have a long and unfortunately dark history in the Czech Republic. One of the most well-known cases is the Avalanche affair (2000–2006), in which company managers, promising high returns, collected more than 400 million CZK from nearly $6\,000$ investors. The funds were used to pay earlier participants from the contributions of new ones — the classic mechanism of a pyramid scheme — which eventually collapsed.

> **Problem 3.**  
> In real cases in the Czech Republic, the number of participants was typically in the thousands. In this problem, assume that after completing a certain level, the total number of participants in our pyramid is between $3\,000$ and $4\,000$.
>
> 1. Which level is it?  
> 2. Determine the percentage of people who are at a loss at this stage.  
> 3. Determine the total profit of the founder of the company.  
> 4. Determine the total profit of an investor at the second level of the pyramid.  
> 5. What percentage of all collected entry fees will be paid to the people in the first three levels of the pyramid?

> **Problem 4.**  
> Reflect on why, in Problems 2.3 and 3.2, the percentage of people at a loss turned out to be almost the same. Was this merely a coincidence, or would we obtain a similar result for other numbers of pyramid levels?

### Questions for Reflection (no calculations required)

* Why does a pyramid scheme inevitably fail, even though it promises quick profits at the beginning? How does the growth in the number of investors relate to real population limits?  

* How would the risk of loss change if you involved relatives or friends in the scheme? What impact might this have on personal relationships?  

* Why are pyramid schemes illegal in most countries?  

* Imagine a pyramid scheme operating today (for example, online). How would you warn others, and what would you do if you were approached?  

* Is a pyramid scheme simply a form of fraud, or do legal forms of multi-level marketing (MLM) exist? Are you familiar with the term MLM? In MLM, a distributor earns money from selling real products (e.g., Avon, Herbalife, Amway) and from commissions on sales within their network — how does this differ from a pyramid scheme, and why is it legal?
